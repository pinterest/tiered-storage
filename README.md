# Pinterest Tiered Storage for Apache Kafka®
Pinterest Tiered Storage for [Apache Kafka®](https://kafka.apache.org/) is a broker-independent framework that allows brokers
to offload finalized log segments to a remote storage system. 
This allows Apache Kafka® to maintain a smaller disk footprint and reduce the need for expensive storage on the brokers. 
The framework also provides a consumer client that can consume from both the broker and the remote storage system.

Pinterest's implementation of Tiered Storage for Apache Kafka® provides a ***broker-independent*** approach to Tiered Storage.
***See the differences between [Pinterest vs. Apache Kafka® Tiered Storage](#pinterest-vs-apache-kafka-tiered-storage)***.

It consists of two main components: 
1. [Uploader](ts-segment-uploader): A continuous process that runs on each Apache Kafka® broker and uploads finalized log segments to a remote storage system (e.g. Amazon S3, with unique prefix per cluster and topic).
2. [Consumer](ts-consumer): A consumer client capable of consuming from both Tiered Storage log segments and Apache Kafka® cluster.

A third module [ts-common](ts-common) contains common classes and interfaces that are used by the `ts-consumer` and `ts-segment-uploader` modules, such as Metrics, StorageEndpointProvider, etc.

Feel free to read into each module's README for more details.

# Why Tiered Storage?
[Apache Kafka®](https://kafka.apache.org/) is a distributed event streaming platform that stores partitioned and replicated log segments on disk for
a configurable retention period. However, as data volume and/or retention periods grow, the disk footprint of Apache Kafka® clusters can become expensive. 
Tiered Storage allows brokers to offload finalized log segments to a more cost-effective remote storage system, reducing the need for expensive storage on the brokers.

With Tiered Storage, you can:
1. Maintain a smaller overall broker footprint, reducing operational costs
2. Retain data for longer periods of time while avoiding horizontal and vertical scaling of Apache Kafka® clusters
3. Reduce CPU, network, and disk I/O utilization on brokers by reading directly from remote storage

## Pinterest vs. Apache Kafka® Tiered Storage
### Apache Kafka® Tiered Storage
[KIP-405](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-405%3A+Kafka+Tiered+Storage?uclick_id=11f222c6-967b-4935-98a9-cc88aafad7f5)
provides a native, open-source offering to Tiered Storage for Apache Kafka® and is available starting from Apache Kafka® 3.6.0.
The native Tiered Storage implementation is broker-dependent, meaning that the broker process itself is responsible 
for offloading finalized log segments to remote storage, and the ***broker is always in the critical path of consumption***.

### Pinterest Tiered Storage: Skip the broker
***Pinterest's implementation of Tiered Storage is broker-independent***, meaning that the Tiered Storage process runs as a separate process alongside the Apache Kafka® server process,
***and the broker is not always in the critical path of consumption***.
This allows for more flexibility in adopting Tiered Storage, and better accommodates unpredictable consumption patterns. 
Some of the key advantages of a broker-independent approach are:

1. **You don't need to upgrade brokers**: While the native offering requires upgrading brokers to a version that supports Tiered Storage, a broker-independent approach does not.
2. **You can skip the broker entirely during consumption**: When in `TIERED_STORAGE_ONLY` mode, the consumption loop does not touch the broker itself, allowing for more
unpredictable spikes in consumption patterns without affecting the broker. See [MemQ](https://github.com/pinterest/memq) for a PubSub system that uses this approach natively.
3. **Support consumer backfills and replays without affecting broker CPU**: When the broker is out of the critical path of consumption,
consumer backfills and replays can be done without needing to keep additional CPU buffer on the brokers just to support those surges.
4. **Avoid cross-AZ transfer costs**: While the native approach adds a cross-AZ network cost factor for consumers that are not AZ-aware,
this broker-independent approach avoids that cost for all consumers when reading directly from remote storage.
5. **Faster adoption, iteration, and improvements**: A broker-independent Tiered Storage solution lets you adopt and upgrade Tiered Storage without
waiting for Apache Kafka® upgrades. Improvements, bug fixes, and new features are released independently of Apache Kafka® releases.

# Highlights
- **Broker Independent**: The tiered storage solution is designed to be broker-independent. [Here's why we think it's better](#pinterest-tiered-storage-for-apache-kafka).
- **Skip the broker entirely during consumption**: The consumer can read from both broker and Tiered Storage backend filesystem. When in `TIERED_STORAGE_ONLY` mode, the consumption loop does not touch the broker itself, allowing for reduction in broker resource utilization.
- **Pluggable Storage Backends**: The framework is designed to be backend-agnostic.
- **S3 Partitioning**: Prefix-entropy (salting) is configurable out-of-the-box to allow for prefix-partitioned S3 buckets, allowing for better scalability by avoiding request rate hotspots.
- **Fault Tolerant**: Broker restarts, replacements, leadership changes, and other common Apache Kafka® operations / issues are handled gracefully.
- **Metrics**: Comprehensive metrics are provided out-of-the-box for monitoring and alerting purposes.

# Quick Start
Detailed quickstart instructions are available [here](docs/quickstart.md).

# Usage
Using Pinterest Tiered Storage for Apache Kafka® consists of the following high-level steps:
1. Have a remote storage system ready to accept reads and writes of log segments (e.g. Amazon S3 bucket)
2. Configure and start [ts-segment-uploader](ts-segment-uploader) on each Apache Kafka® broker
3. Use [ts-consumer](ts-consumer) to read from either the broker or the remote storage system
4. Monitor and manage the tiered storage system using the provided metrics and tools

# Current Status
**Pinterest Tiered Storage for Apache Kafka® is currently under active development and the APIs may change over time.**

It currently supports the following remote storage systems:
- Amazon S3

Some planned features and improvements:

- KRaft support
- More storage system support (e.g. HDFS)
- Integration with [PubSub Client](https://github.com/pinterest/psc) (backend-agnostic client library)

Contributions are always welcome!
